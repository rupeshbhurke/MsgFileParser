# MSG File Parser

A .NET 8.0 console application that extracts content from Microsoft Outlook MSG files and converts them to readable text format.

## Features

- üìß Extract email metadata (subject, sender, recipients, date)
- üìù Support for multiple body formats (Plain Text, HTML, RTF) - **Not tested!**
- üéØ Flexible output options (specific filename or directory)
- ‚ö° Fast and efficient processing
- üîß Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux, macOS)

## Prerequisites

- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
- For Linux users: `libgdiplus` library (usually pre-installed)

## Installation of .NET SDK

```bask
wget https://dot.net/v1/dotnet-install.sh -O dotnet-install.sh

chmod +x ./dotnet-install.sh

./dotnet-install.sh --version latest
```

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

## Usage

The application supports three different usage patterns:

### 1. Specific Output Filename
```bash
dotnet run "input.msg" "output.txt"
```
Creates a file with your exact specified name and location.

### 2. Directory Output
```bash
dotnet run "input.msg" "./output/"
dotnet run "input.msg" "."
```
Auto-generates filename based on MSG file name and places it in the specified directory.

### 3. Default Behavior
```bash
dotnet run "input.msg"
```
Auto-generates filename in the same directory as the MSG file.

## Examples

```bash
# Extract to custom filename
dotnet run "email.msg" "extracted_email.txt"

# Extract to current directory with auto-generated name
dotnet run "email.msg" "."

# Extract to same directory as MSG file
dotnet run "email.msg"

# Extract to specific directory
dotnet run "email.msg" "/path/to/output/"
```

## Output Format

The extracted text file contains:

- **Subject**: Email subject line
- **From**: Sender information
- **Date**: Email timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss format)
- **Recipients**: List of all recipients with email addresses and display names
- **Body**: Email content (preserves formatting from original)

### Sample Output
```
Subject: Meeting Tomorrow
From: john.doe@example.com
Date: 2023-04-11 11:55:37

Recipients:
- jane.smith@example.com (Jane Smith)
- team@example.com (Team)

Body:
Hello Team,

Please join us for the meeting tomorrow at 2 PM.

Best regards,
